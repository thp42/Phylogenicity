Divergence Event 3:
  Taxonomy: Vertebrata
  Parent Isoforms: {'ITPKB': 541, 'ITPKA': 515, 'None': 257, 'ITPKC': 331}
  Child Distributions:
    Child 1 (Vertebrata): {'ITPKB': 97, 'ITPKA': 515, 'None': 215, 'ITPKC': 331}
    Child 2 (Gnathostomata): {'None': 42, 'ITPKB': 444}
  Total leaves: 1644
  Proportion of total tree: 71.23%
  Evolutionary Significance:
    - This event represents a major divergence in ITPK evolution, affecting 71.23% of all analyzed sequences.
    - The ancestral lineage at the Vertebrata level had multiple ITPK isoforms: ITPKB, ITPKA, None, ITPKC.
    - A significant portion of ITPKB (444/541, 82.07%) transitioned to the Gnathostomata lineage.
    - A significant portion of ITPKA (515/515, 100.00%) transitioned to the Vertebrata lineage.
    - A significant portion of None (215/257, 83.66%) transitioned to the Vertebrata lineage.
    - A significant portion of ITPKC (331/331, 100.00%) transitioned to the Vertebrata lineage.

    Child 2 (Gnathostomata): {'ITPKC': 326, 'ITPKA': 20, 'None': 144, 'ITPKB': 1}
  Total leaves: 984
  Proportion of total tree: 42.63%
  Evolutionary Significance:
    - This event represents a major divergence in ITPK evolution, affecting 42.63% of all analyzed sequences.
    - The ancestral lineage at the Gnathostomata level had multiple ITPK isoforms: ITPKA, None, ITPKC, ITPKB.
    - A significant portion of ITPKA (456/476, 95.80%) transitioned to the Gnathostomata lineage.
    - A significant portion of None (144/181, 79.56%) transitioned to the Gnathostomata lineage.
    - A significant portion of ITPKC (326/326, 100.00%) transitioned to the Gnathostomata lineage.
    - A significant portion of ITPKB (1/1, 100.00%) transitioned to the Gnathostomata lineage.
